Random Movie Generator based on themoviedb.org API


## Running

To run the project it is necessary to create an account in themoviedb.og site and generate a Token API in the settings of the account, this link teaches how to do:
[ThemovieDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

Once you have the api key, pass as argument as follows:
```
./what-to-watch -apikey=00000fffffxxxxkkkkk
```
```
